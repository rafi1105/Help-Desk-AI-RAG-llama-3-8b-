    "answer": "\n                To provide you with the information you're looking for, I need to clarify what \"CSE\" refers to in your context. In Bangladesh, CSE typically stands for Computer Science and Engineering. However, without more specific information about the course or the institution you are referring to (e.g., University of Dhaka, University of Rajshahi), it's difficult for me to give a precise answer.If you're looking for information on fees for Computer Science and Engineering courses at your preferred university in Bangladesh, I can suggest some general steps:‚Ä¢Check with the university: Visit the website of your desired university or contact their admissions office directly to ask about course fees. You may need to provide your student ID number or other necessary details to access this information.‚Ä¢Consult the university's fee structure: Most universities in Bangladesh publish their fee structures on their official websites or through their portals. The fee information is usually categorized by semester or for the entire academic year.‚Ä¢Contact the departmental office: Reach out to the Computer Science and Engineering department of your preferred university. They should be able to provide you with detailed information about course fees, including any additional costs like examination fees.Regarding programming or technical topics related to CSE courses:For example, a basic introduction to Python can be found on the official Python website: https://www.python.org/. Here's a simple \"Hello, World!\" program in Python that demonstrates how to print a message to the console:print(\"Hello, World!\")If you're looking for more advanced topics or specific coding concepts, I'd recommend searching for those on websites like Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/), GitHub (https://github.com/), or online tutorials and courses on platforms like Codecademy (https://www.codecademy.com/learn) or edX (https://www.edx.org/).\n                \n                \n                    üëçHelpful\n                \n                \n                    üëéNot helpful\n                \n            \n            ",
